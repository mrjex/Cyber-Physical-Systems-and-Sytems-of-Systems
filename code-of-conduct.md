1. How do we plan to collaborate?

We plan to communicate through discord and have regular in-person meetings. The meetings will take place on a
consistent basis, allowing each member to quickly voice their opinions on any conflicting matters or any
information of high importance that has a significant impact on the group's progression.

Assigning invididual responsiblity to meet decided internal deadlines is our way of incorporating a way of agile
collaboration, in the sense that with responsbility comes authority and decision-making that aren't micromanaged.
This allows for a mometum to grow, while avoiding the case where the micromanaged individuals become frustrated
and contributing to a tense atmosphere that does nothing but amplify the negative environment. Moreover, Kelly
(2020) states that "The best Agile Leadership Teams are continuously coached and are coaching themselves to
evolve, learn, and grow".



2. How do we ensure that everyone in our group stays informed about the individual contributions?

Besides our frequent meetings, we will communicate through discord, where we divide content into sections. We will
distribute the textual information into seperate categories and channels to counteract the scenario where one single
channel is bloated, making it easy to miss out on crucial pieces of information. Hence, restricting information to
certain channels attaches a priority and context that enables each member to distinguish between small-talk and
productive/progressive discussions related to the course.


3. How do we ensure knowledge transfer among our team members?

If someone can't attend a lecture or faces problems, we have all agreed to assist that person in the process
of learning. In addition, we account for cases in which someone is sick, by dividing the 4-person team into
pairs that have been designated a larger area of responsibility in the programming project. For instance,
2 people will invest more time in coming up with an algorithm, leaving the remaining ones with continious
integration and deployment as well as the support of docker-related executables for the main operating systems.
Google drive to share data and files so that they are easily accessed by each member as an additonal collaborative tools



4. What is our usual communication plan?
 - Discord
 - In-person meetigs

Everyone is expected to state "important" information, and we define "important" as follows:
	- Piece of information that is crucial for the team's success, such that
	  the difference in not obtaining that information has major consequences
          in time and effort of other team members.

Below are some instances in which our agreed definition of "important" is relevant:
	- A member informs other members with similar operating systems about crucial yet unexpected
	  but time consuming installing of dependencies issues
	- A member can't make it to the meeting (state at least 12 hours in advance)



5. How will we solve conflicts?

In order to mitigate conflict everyone should be as transparent as possible in the specified communication channels (discord) within 2 business days. In addition we will follow some aspects of the SCRUM methodology such as having sprint planning and sprint reviews,to encourage an open dialogue and clear expectations. 

To make it fair, we will use democracy in favor of the majority. In this way, we embrace everyone's opinion, avoiding
the conflict where one doesn't feel like his/her voice is heard. This further supports our aforementioned approach on
maintaining the agile principle of individual leadership and the liberation of the constraints coupled with micromanagement.

Ideally, one's words perfectly aligns with one's actions and contributions to the group: If a person says that he will finish
a task before Tuesday, and if he actually does it, then he is considered accountable. On the other hand, it's impossible to predict
the amount of time and effort a task needs in advance, especially in the realm of programming. Therefore, we expect the person to
state one's unanticipated issues encountered early on to avoid unpleasant surprises for the rest of the group.

These are the foundational building blocks and blueprint for our problem resolutions. The democracy to account for everyone's nuanced
opinions and the accountability principle to draw a line between one's lack of communication or lack of progressive work allows us to
assign responsibility to each one, which makes it easier to know who violated the team agreements.



6. How do you plan to ensure responsible use of LLMs in your project and how do you transparently and traceably document the use of LLMs?

In case there are challenging problems where no documentation on the issue exists, some members are inclined to use LLM as an assisting tool
Separate google document for all LLM-usage detailing where exactly we use it in the coding project / final document.

Also include a reference to verify the LLM's suggestion as we dont accept the risk of possible hallucinated information. (reference could be a link to documentionation or a manual)
